This page describes each of the homework assignments, listed by the session in which they are due. It also provides some **suggested datasets** for each sketch, and selected examples of **student work** from the 2017 and 2016 classes on some assignments and the final project. (While the 2016 version of the class wasn't specifically focused on climate change, the sample works are good illustrations of overall goals of the assignments.)

See the syllabus {{% resource_link "b5c6793d-89a7-6651-965c-2e307d908dd0" "Course Requirements" "#course_reqs" %}} section for more details on these assignments and grading criteria.

- what data is being shown
- who you think the audience is
- what you think the goals of the data presentation are
- whether you think it is effective or not and why

- The audience you want to make something for (remember "general public" is an unacceptable audience!)
- Good but not required: one abstract word in your data story that you need help representing in concrete ways ("inequality", "hate", "asylum", etc.)
